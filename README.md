# BASIC8

BASIC8 is an integrated virtual computer for game and other program development. Users can create, share and play cartridges in a BASIC dialect, with retro 8-bit style flavour, and some built-in tools for editing sprites, maps, sounds and etc.

The interpreter part of BASIC8 is powered by the [MY-BASIC](https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic) project.

This project is WIP, and existing features and behaviours may be changed.
