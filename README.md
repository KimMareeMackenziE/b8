## BASIC8

[Why BASIC8?](https://my-basic.github.io/basic8/docs/why) | [Manual](https://my-basic.github.io/basic8/docs/manual) | [Changelog](https://my-basic.github.io/basic8/docs/changelog)

BASIC8 is an integrated fantasy computer for game and other program development. Users can create, share and play cartridges in a BASIC dialect, with retro 8-bit style flavour, and some built-in tools for editing sprites, maps, sounds and etc.

This project is WIP, and existing features and behaviours may be changed.
