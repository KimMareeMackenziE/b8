# MY-BASIC Builder

"MY-BASIC Builder" is an integrated game and app development software with retro style graphics and modern syntax BASIC. All in a [Unikernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel) framework.

The interpreter part of MY-BASIC Builder is powered by the [MY-BASIC](https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic) project.

This project is WIP, and existing features and behaviours may be changed.
