[Why BASIC8?](https://paladin-t.github.io/basic8/pages/why) | [Manual](https://paladin-t.github.io/basic8/docs/manual) | [Changelog](https://paladin-t.github.io/basic8/docs/changelog)

BASIC8 is an integrated fantasy computer for game and other program development. Users can create, share and play cartridges in a BASIC dialect, with retro 8-bit style flavour, and some built-in tools for editing sprites, maps, sounds, etc.

This project is WIP, any documented features and behaviours may be changed in official release.
