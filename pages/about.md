## About

Call me Tony Wang, or just Tony. I used to develop video games as an employee for years, I also developed some indie games. I found myself significantly successful at doing two kind of things: making unsuccessful indie games, and making game development tools. So I decided to put efforts on the second one to make BASIC8, hope you enjoy it.
