## About

Call me Tony Wang, or just Tony. I used to develop video games in big companies for quite a bit of time, and also developed some indie games. Eventually I found myself doing significantly successful at two kind of things: making unsuccessful indie games, and making game development tools. So I decided to put efforts on the latter making BASIC8, everything here begins from that day, hope you enjoy it as much as I do creating it.
